Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed n, find the sum of the even-valued terms.





#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
   int n;
   cin>>n;
   int a=1;
   int b=2;
   int fib=a+b;
   int esum=2;
   
   while(fib<n)
   {
      a=b;
      b=fib;
      fib=fib+a;
      
      if(fib%2==0)
      esum=esum+fib;
      
       
   }
   cout<<esum;
   return 0;
}
